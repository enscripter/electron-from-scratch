Intro: what is electron?
- easy cross-platform desktop apps
- chromium browser hosted in a node.js process
- we need to write code for both parts

You can just download some boilerplate and get running quickly - we're going to go the slow way

Commands:

> npm init
> npm install --save-dev electron

- npm here acts as an equivalent combination of nuget, the csproj file, and a place to store build scripts.
- --save vs --save-dev : dev dependencies are used at build time instead of runtime.
  (the difference doesn't really matter to us since we're not building a package, but it's still a nice way of organising things)
