Commands:

> dotnet new webapi
> npm run build-server
> npm run run-server

- we could probably build the entire application with electron/node
- however we tend to prefer writing code in C#
- we'll run a .NET process to do most of the heavy lifting and talk to it somehow
  - web API (fairly natural, but heavyweight)
  - json-rpc over stdio (cool alternative, used for vscode extensions)
  - one-shot commandline (simpler, can't keep state in memory)
  - edge.js (easiest, but a bit magic + not well supported)

- `dotnet new webapi` quickly inits a webserver project for us
- filled in some stub code for a 'workspaces/projects/migrations' controller

- electron can intercept + handle web requests coming from the browser process
  - eg ignore certificate errors (not ideal but works)

- our react app now has some more complicated logic with useState
