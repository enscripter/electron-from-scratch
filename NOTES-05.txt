- introducing react and webpack
  - react is our UI library
  - webpack takes various source files (including react) and packs them together
  - this is a big jump in complexity for our build step

- separate webpack configs for electron and website processes
  - one runs in a browser, the other runs in node
  - the available modules and module systems work differently for each
  - webpack configures the entire build all in one place
    - this is unlike some other tools which create a pipeline of build steps

- react lets us describe what we want the UI to look like, and then does efficient updates for us
  - much cleaner than manipulating the html DOM directly
  - many many excellent resources for react on the web
  - we use JSX as the templating language
    - like writing inline HTML in UI components
    - a bit weird but it works well
    - needs a tsconfig update
