- installed product / gui tests:
  - spectron lets us run webdriver stuff on the website inside of electron
  - works pretty well (standard gui test problems apply)

- Packaging: bundling the electron app up into a redistributable bundle
  - there are a few tools for this:
    - electron-builder will create an installer with very slick autoupdate
    - electron-packager does a bit less, but works with the RG installer

- linting and formatting:
  - we can use tslint/eslint to find a whole range of issues, similar to R#/sonarqube
  - we use prettier to solve formatting arguments forever
  - .editorconfig is also useful

- source maps:
  - these are like PDBs - they provide a map of compiled js back to original ts source
  - chrome can use these when debugging
  - webpack can make them for us

- hot module replacement:
  - we can live-reload some bits of our website without having to reload the entire page
  - very useful for tweaking UI bits
  - also try test benches

- libraries we explicitly didn't use:
  - react-router is a good example:
    - it's a standard library for React SPAs, but
    - we can go a long way with very simple discriminated union for pages
    - we don't need url/history management for an electron app
    - it's good to keep redux as the source of truth
  - always be deliberate about the libraries you pick
