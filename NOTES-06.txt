Commands:

> npm install --save-dev sass-loader node-sass css-loader postcss-loader autoprefixer style-loader url-loader
> npm install --save git+https://github.com/red-gate/honeycomb-web-toolkit.git

- getting styling working is complicated!
- honeycomb-web-toolkit comes as a set of sass files
  - we need to compile these to plain CSS
- sass files get their own little pipeline configured in the webpack config
  - we also need to handle icons/images/fonts/etc
- we need to set some variables to get paths to resolve correctly

- we extract some more react components to style things
  - it's nice how these compose together
