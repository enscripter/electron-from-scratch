- want to load a local html file instead of an online website
- added some basic interactivity
- use `setMenuBarVisibility` to hide the electron menu bar
  - pretending we're not a browser
  - the keyboard shortcuts still exist, though (devtools are handy!)
- we can totally build apps with vanilla js, but it can get messy very quickly
