- we want the electron app to manage the webserver
  - we can't get the user to run both in parallel

- since we're running a webserver we need to worry about ports
  - just picking a random port will work ... most of the time
  - binding to port 0 means "pick an available port"
  - but then the website doesn't know which port to send requests to!

- we need the electron process to:
  - start the webserver
  - figure out what port the webserver is running on
  - tell the website process where to send requests

- we can also use this process to pass around an auth token
  - this is marginally more secure
  - we use JWT, which is a neat piece of tech
